This is a shitty personal project that uses the M3508 bldc motors from DJI.  
The whole project is based on arduino with freeRTOS running on ESP32.  

Library used:  
  arduino CAN  
  
Self-Developed library: 
  DJI Motor Control for C620(For M3508) and C610(For M2006)  
  Brushed DC Motor Control
  The one somehow works, PID lib
  The one not yet ready to go, serial communication lib
